= ReportsAsSparkline

ReportsAsSparkline enables you to generate reports and sparklines from your model's data with very little effort.

== Example

This shows the basic usage. Consider the following user model, including +created_at+ and +activated_at+ timestamp fields.

  class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    report_as_sparkline :registrations
    report_as_sparkline :activations,  :date_column_name => :activated_at
    report_as_sparkline :total_users,  :cumulate         => true
    end

Using +report_as_sparkline+ like this will add the following class methods to your User model:

  User.registrations_report
  User.activations_report
  User.total_users_report

You can than render sparklines for these reports with sparkline_tag in your view:

  <%= sparkline_tag(User.registrations_report) %>

== TODOs/ future plans

* support for Oracle and DB2 (and others?) missing
* Implement data ranges in arguments
* Limit number of data points to maximum that the google chart api allows
* Make graph styling configurable
